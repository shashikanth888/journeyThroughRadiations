# journey-through-radiations
Prototype for educational tool that uses radiation information from the Canadian Space Agency to create a story for students to understand its effect on their health

Created by Abeer Khan and Shashikanth Srinath during the Space Apps hackathon 2019. We deal with RadiN2 challenge. Won the RadiN2 challenge for the Waterloo chapter, qualifying for nationals.

Ideas for improvements:
1. Retain DOS interface. 
2. Add more variables for calculating their combined impact on the player's health, such as air pollution index, water pollution, etc. 
3. Create story "turning points" or "landmarks" for each variables & option combination that involves real life events. Use neural networks to automatically create a story line depending on these hinges. 
4. Add a positive influences of activities, for e.g. positive results of environmental policies of cities, or good values of pollution indices, etc. 
5. Add animations in ASCII - art.

We used many useful resources that are we grateful to, such as:
1. img2txt. https://github.com/hit9/img2txt . We didn't end up using this but maybe in the future.
2. http://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Graffiti&t=Type%20Something%20. - Text to ascii art
3. https://www.ascii-art-generator.org . We didn't end up using this but maybe in the future.
